# AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding

AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding implementation.
* Please take note that this encryption is vulnerable. A padding oracle attack is a type of attack against encrypted data that allows the attacker to decrypt the contents of the data, without knowing the key.


# AES/GCM/NoPadding
AES/GCM/NoPadding implementation. 
* GCM is more robust and secure than CBC.
